To implement autonomous ship control, both guidance and control systems must be utilized. The guidance system is responsible for providing the reference signal that directs the ship to follow a predefined waypoint or path. The control system, on the other hand, involves designing a controller to track the reference signal, ensuring that the ship minimizes tracking errors and achieves stable and accurate performance.
