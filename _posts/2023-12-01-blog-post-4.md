We had the chance to introduce our work on light pollution and address the issue for the coastline at the [OSRC Conference](https://calendar.hr.ufl.edu/event/optimizing-solutions-for-resilient-coasts-summit/). We showcased our solution to attendees and received valuable feedback that will help guide our future research.
