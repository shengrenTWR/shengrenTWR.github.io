During this great summer, I attended the [2024 Autonomous System Bootcamp](https://sites.udel.edu/ceoe-able/able-summer-bootcamp/) at the University of Delaware for 5 days. The topics of the bootcamp focused on ocean autonomous vehicles, such as underwater gliders and autonomous surface vehicles. My team focused on glider trajectory prediction. We used the steady-state equations and kinematic models along with the physical parameters of the glider, such as mass and buoyancy, to predict the trajectory underwater. This is important because GPS signals can be lost underwater. The results can help researchers further estimate the location of the glider after deployment.
