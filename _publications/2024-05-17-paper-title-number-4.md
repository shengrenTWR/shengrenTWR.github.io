Light pollution stems from excessive, misdirected, or indiscriminate use of artificial lights at night; it has profound impacts on human health, nocturnal animals, and coastal ecosystems. The existing systems for light pollution monitoring (LPM) rely on error-prone manual surveys or use low-resolution satellite data for basic analysis. In this work, we present the design, development, and early field experimental analyses of a portable, scalable, and low-power solution for multimodal light-field sensing in vulnerable coastal communities of Florida, US. The intelligent data acquisition and reporting capabilities of the proposed system enable automatic and dynamic light-field sensing for long-term LPM.
